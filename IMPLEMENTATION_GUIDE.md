## Getting Started

### Step 1: Understand the Current State

1. Read **DEFECT_REPORT.md** to understand all identified issues
2. Review **TESTING_SUMMARY.md** to see test coverage
3. Prioritize defects by severity:
   - **12 Critical** - Must fix before production
   - **18 High** - Fix in first month
   - **24 Medium** - Fix within 2 months
   - **15 Low** - Address as time permits

### Step 2: Set Up Project Tracking

1. Import **STORY_TRACKER.csv** into your project management tool:
   - JIRA: Import as CSV
   - Azure DevOps: Import work items
   - GitHub Projects: Create issues from CSV
   - Spreadsheet: Use directly in Excel/Google Sheets

2. Create Epics in your project management tool:
   ```
   EPIC-001: Input Validation Framework (28 points)
   EPIC-002: Security Hardening (35 points)
   EPIC-003: Data Integrity & Transactions (25 points)
   EPIC-004: Test Infrastructure Setup (20 points)
   EPIC-005: Audit & Compliance Framework (30 points)

   ```

3. Create Stories from the CSV:
   - Each row is a user story
   - Link stories to epics
   - Set story points
   - Mark dependencies

## Story Implementation Workflow

### For Each Story

1. **Read Story Details**
   - Open corresponding section in EPICS_AND_STORIES.md or EPICS_CONTINUED.md
   - Review acceptance criteria
   - Understand technical requirements
   - Check dependencies

2. **Create Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b story/STORY-XXX.X-short-description
   ```

3. **Implement Solution**
   - Follow technical implementation in story
   - Create/modify files as specified
   - Write code following examples provided

4. **Write Tests**
   - Create unit tests (in tests/unit/)
   - Create integration tests (in tests/integration/)
   - Follow testing requirements in story
   - Ensure >80% coverage for new code

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test -- tests/unit/path/to/test.js
   npm test -- tests/integration/api/module.api.test.js
   npm run test:all  # Run full suite
   ```

6. **Code Review**
   - Create pull request
   - Link to story in PR description
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI
   - Address review comments

7. **Merge & Mark Complete**
   - Merge to develop branch
   - Update story status to "Done" in tracker
   - Verify in staging environment
   - Update story notes with any lessons learned

### Definition of Done (Every Story)

- [ ] Code implemented according to acceptance criteria
- [ ] All specified tests written and passing
- [ ] Code coverage > 80% for new code
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] No regression in existing tests
- [ ] Security review passed (for security stories)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and verified
- [ ] Story marked complete in tracker

## Testing Strategy

### Test Execution Plan

1. **After Each Story**
   ```bash
   # Run affected tests
   npm test -- tests/unit/module.test.js
   npm test -- tests/integration/api/module.api.test.js
   ```

2. **After Each Epic**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   npm run test:all

   # Check coverage
   npm test -- --coverage

   # Performance tests
   npm run test:performance
   ```

3. **Before Each Sprint Demo**
   ```bash
   # Full regression
   npm run test:all

   # Security scan
   npm audit

   # E2E tests
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

### Test Infrastructure Requirements

Before starting Sprint 1, ensure:
- [ ] PostgreSQL installed and configured
- [ ] Test database created
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Tests can connect to database

```bash
# Setup test database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
npm run init-db:test

# Verify tests work
npm test
```

## Monitoring Progress

### Daily Standup Questions

1. What story did you complete yesterday?
2. What story are you working on today?
3. Any blockers or dependencies?
4. Are tests passing?

### Sprint Review Metrics

Track these metrics at the end of each sprint:

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Stories Completed | 100% of sprint | |
| Story Points Completed | As planned | |
| Test Pass Rate | > 95% | |
| Code Coverage | > 80% | |
| Defects Fixed | Per sprint plan | |
| Security Scan | Pass | |

### Epic Completion Checklist

When an epic is complete:

- [ ] All stories in epic marked "Done"
- [ ] Epic-level tests passing
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo to stakeholders completed
- [ ] Retrospective notes captured

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Tests failing with database connection error**
```
Solution:
1. Check PostgreSQL is running: docker-compose ps
2. Verify connection string in .env.test
3. Run: npm run init-db:test
```

**Issue: Story has unclear requirements**
```
Solution:
1. Review defect report (DEFECT_REPORT.md) for context
2. Review similar implemented stories for patterns
3. Consult with team lead
4. Update story with clarifications
```

**Issue: Story dependencies blocking progress**
```
Solution:
1. Check STORY_TRACKER.csv dependencies column
2. Verify dependency story is complete
3. Consider implementing in parallel if possible
4. Adjust sprint plan if needed
```

**Issue: Tests pass locally but fail in CI**
```
Solution:
1. Check CI environment variables
2. Verify test database setup in CI
3. Check for timing issues (add delays if needed)
4. Review CI logs for specific errors
```

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

- Follow existing code style
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing

- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Test happy path and error cases
- Test boundary conditions
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests fast (<5 seconds for unit tests)

### Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate ALL user input
- Use parameterized queries
- Log security events
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Documentation

- Update README when adding features
- Document API changes in Swagger
- Add inline code comments
- Update architecture docs for major changes
- Keep runbook current

## Communication

### Story Updates

Post updates in team channel:
```
✅ STORY-001.1 Complete
- Created validation middleware framework
- Added 20 unit tests, all passing
- Documentation updated
- Ready for review
```

### Blocker Escalation

If blocked >1 day:
```
🚨 BLOCKED: STORY-002.4
- Waiting for Redis setup in staging
- Cannot test rate limiting
- Need DevOps support
```

### Sprint Demo Format

For each completed story:
1. Show the problem (before)
2. Demonstrate the solution (after)
3. Show tests passing
4. Discuss challenges and learnings

## Success Criteria
