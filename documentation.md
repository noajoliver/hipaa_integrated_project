## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- The application uses JWT for authentication
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Role-based access control restricts access to features
- Session timeout for inactive users

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- HTTPS is required for production deployments
- Database backups should be encrypted
- File uploads are scanned for malware

### Audit Logging

- All user actions are logged
- System events are recorded
- Audit logs cannot be modified
- Regular audit log review is recommended

### Compliance Considerations

- Regular security assessments should be conducted
- Password policies should be enforced
- Data retention policies should be implemented
- Business Associate Agreements should be in place

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues

- **Symptom**: Application fails to start with database connection errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify PostgreSQL is running
  - Check database credentials in .env file
  - Ensure the database and user exist
  - Test connection directly with psql

#### Authentication Issues

- **Symptom**: Unable to log in despite correct credentials
- **Solution**:
  - Check for case sensitivity in username
  - Verify the user is active in the system
  - Clear browser cookies and cache
  - Reset password if necessary

#### Performance Issues

- **Symptom**: Slow application response
- **Solution**:
  - Check database indexes
  - Verify server resources
  - Optimize large queries
  - Consider scaling the application
