# Security Enhancements for HIPAA Compliance

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in Phase 5 of the HIPAA compliance application improvement plan.

## Overview

The security enhancements focus on meeting HIPAA security requirements by implementing:

1. Advanced Authentication Security
2. Data Protection
3. Session Management
4. Secure Communication
5. Access Controls
6. Security Monitoring and Auditing

## Key Security Features

### Enhanced Authentication

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - TOTP-based MFA implementation (Time-based One-Time Password)
  - Backup code generation and management
  - MFA enforcement for sensitive operations

- **Advanced Password Security**
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Password expiration and history
  - Account lockout after failed attempts
  - Secure password reset flow with tokenization

- **Security Questions**
  - Secure storage of security question/answer pairs
  - Support for account recovery via security questions

### Session Management

- **Secure Session Handling**
  - Redis-backed session store for persistent sessions
  - Session timeout and automatic expiration
  - Session tracking across multiple devices
  - Ability to view and revoke active sessions

- **Enhanced Token Security**
  - Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation
  - Token revocation and blacklisting
  - Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies
  - CSRF protection for all sensitive operations

### Data Protection

- **PHI Encryption**
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for Protected Health Information
  - Transparent field-level encryption/decryption
  - Secure key management

- **Sensitive Data Masking**
  - Automatic masking of sensitive information in logs
  - Secure error handling that prevents leaking sensitive data

### Network and Communication Security

- **Content Security Policy**
  - Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
  - Nonce-based inline script protection
  - Restrictive default policy with targeted exceptions

- **Transport Security**
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Secure cookie settings (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
  - TLS requirement enforcement

- **Permissions Policy**
  - Restrictive browser feature permissions
  - Disabling of sensitive browser APIs

### Access Controls

- **IP Allowlisting**
  - Support for IP-based access restrictions
  - CIDR notation support for network ranges
  - Per-user IP allowlist management

- **Fine-grained Authorization**
  - Role-based access control
  - Permission-based security checks
  - Comprehensive security audit logging

## Implementation Details

### Security Middleware

The application includes a comprehensive security middleware stack:

- `security.js`: Advanced HTTP security headers and policies
- `data-protection.js`: PHI encryption and sensitive data handling
- `mfa.js`: Multi-factor authentication enforcement
- `account-protection.js`: Account lockout and brute force protection

### Services

- `security.service.js`: Core security operations including:
  - Account lockout management
  - Password history and verification
  - MFA token verification and backup codes
  - Security question management
  - IP allowlist management
  - Security event logging

### Utilities

- `encryption.js`: AES-256-GCM encryption for PHI
- `session-manager.js`: Secure session management with Redis
- `token-manager.js`: JWT token generation and verification

## Configuration

Security features can be configured through environment variables:

```
# Password Security
PASSWORD_EXPIRY_DAYS=90
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=12
PASSWORD_HISTORY_SIZE=24
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5
ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_MINUTES=30

# Session Security
SESSION_TIMEOUT=30m
REFRESH_TIMEOUT=7d
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# TLS/HSTS Settings
HSTS_MAX_AGE=31536000
HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS=true
HSTS_PRELOAD=true
```

## Usage Guidelines

### MFA Implementation

To implement MFA for a user:
1. Generate MFA secret using `setupMFA`
2. Present QR code to user for scanning
3. Verify initial token with `enableMFA`
4. Store backup codes securely

### Session Management

The system supports:
- Multiple concurrent sessions per user
- Session activity tracking
- Remote session termination
- Force logout across all devices

### PHI Encryption

All PHI data should be encrypted using the `encryptPhiObject` utility before storage:

```javascript
const encryptedData = encryptPhiObject(patientData, ['name', 'ssn', 'medicalRecords']);
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Always enforce MFA for privileged operations
2. Implement the principle of least privilege for all user roles
3. Regularly audit security logs for suspicious activity
4. Rotate encryption keys and passwords on a regular schedule
5. Keep all dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities
