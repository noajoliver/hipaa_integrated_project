## Test Execution Status

### Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED**

**Reason:** PostgreSQL database is not available in the test environment.

**Error:**
```
ConnectionRefusedError [SequelizeConnectionRefusedError]:
connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
```

### Infrastructure Requirements

To execute the test suite, the following infrastructure is required:

1. **PostgreSQL Server**
   - Version: 12.x or higher
   - Test database: `hipaa_compliance_test`
   - User credentials configured in environment variables

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=hipaa_compliance_test
   DB_USERNAME=test_user
   DB_PASSWORD=test_password
   NODE_ENV=test
   ```

3. **Database Initialization**
   - Run migration scripts
   - Seed test data
   - Create necessary indexes

## Code Analysis Findings

Despite the inability to execute tests due to infrastructure limitations, comprehensive **static code analysis** revealed significant defects:

### Defect Summary by Severity

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| üî¥ **CRITICAL** | 12 | Missing input validation, SQL injection risks, race conditions |
| üü† **HIGH** | 18 | Missing pagination, incomplete audit logging, IDOR vulnerabilities |
| üü° **MEDIUM** | 24 | Inconsistent error handling, missing caching, poor logging |
| üü¢ **LOW** | 15 | Code formatting, documentation gaps, unused code |
| **TOTAL** | **69** | See DEFECT_REPORT.md for details |

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **C-001: Missing Input Validation** - Numeric fields accept negative values, NaN, invalid ranges
2. **C-003: Race Condition** - Document acknowledgments can be duplicated
3. **C-004: Unvalidated parseInt** - NaN propagation breaking queries
4. **C-007: Password Exposure** - Error messages leak sensitive data
5. **C-008: No Transaction Support** - Data inconsistency in multi-step operations
6. **C-009: IDOR Vulnerability** - Users can complete others' training
7. **C-011: Path Traversal** - File paths not sanitized

### High Priority Issues

1. **H-002: Missing Pagination** - Memory exhaustion on large datasets
2. **H-004: Missing Audit Logging** - HIPAA compliance violation
